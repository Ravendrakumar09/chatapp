# Complete Video Calling Setup Guide

## üéâ New Video Calling Features Added

I've implemented a complete video calling system that allows users to make and receive video calls with proper remote user connections. Here's what's been added:

### ‚úÖ New Components Created

1. **`useVideoCall.ts`** - Custom hook for managing Twilio Video SDK
2. **`useVideoCallNotifications.ts`** - Hook for real-time call notifications
3. **`VideoCallModal.tsx`** - Full-featured video call interface
4. **`IncomingCallModal.tsx`** - Incoming call notification UI
5. **Database migration** - `video_call_notifications` table

### ‚úÖ Features Implemented

- **Real-time Video Calls**: Users can now make and receive video calls
- **Room Management**: Automatic room creation and joining
- **Call Notifications**: Real-time notifications for incoming calls
- **Call Controls**: Mute/unmute audio, enable/disable video, end call
- **User Coordination**: Proper coordination between users for call acceptance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Making a Video Call
1. User clicks the video call button next to a chat
2. System creates a unique room name
3. Sends notification to the other user
4. Initiates video call with Twilio Video SDK

### 2. Receiving a Video Call
1. User receives real-time notification
2. Can accept or reject the call
3. If accepted, both users join the same video room
4. Full video/audio communication established

### 3. During the Call
- Local and remote video streams
- Audio/video toggle controls
- Call status indicators
- Proper cleanup on call end

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` file has the required Twilio credentials:

```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_API_KEY_SID=your_api_key_sid_here
TWILIO_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

### 2. Database Setup
Run the database migration to create the video call notifications table:

```sql
-- The migration file is already created at:
-- supabase/migrations/001_create_video_call_notifications.sql
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
All required dependencies are already in `package.json`:
- `twilio-video`: Twilio Video SDK
- `twilio`: Twilio server SDK
- `jsonwebtoken`: For token generation

### 4. Test the Setup
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open two browser tabs/windows
3. Login as different users
4. Try making a video call between them

## üì± User Experience

### For the Caller:
1. Click video call button next to a user
2. See "Calling [User Name]..." toast
3. Video call modal opens with local video
4. Wait for other user to accept
5. Once accepted, see remote video stream

### For the Receiver:
1. See incoming call notification popup
2. Click "Accept" or "Decline"
3. If accepted, video call modal opens
4. Both users can see each other's video

### During the Call:
- Toggle video on/off
- Toggle audio on/off
- End call button
- Real-time connection status

## üîß Technical Details

### Room Management
- Each call gets a unique room name: `video-call-{user1}-{user2}-{timestamp}`
- Rooms are automatically created and managed by Twilio
- Proper cleanup when calls end

### Real-time Notifications
- Uses Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Notifications stored in `video_call_notifications` table
- Automatic cleanup of old notifications

### Video/Audio Handling
- Uses Twilio Video SDK for reliable connections
- Automatic camera/microphone access
- Proper track management and cleanup

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to get token" Error**:
   - Check Twilio credentials in `.env.local`
   - Restart development server after adding credentials

2. **No Video/Audio**:
   - Check browser permissions for camera/microphone
   - Ensure HTTPS in production (required for Twilio)

3. **Call Notifications Not Working**:
   - Check Supabase connection
   - Verify database migration was run
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **"Connection Error" in Video Call**:
   - Check Twilio account status
   - Verify API credentials are correct
   - Check network connectivity

### Debug Steps:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check console for error messages
3. Test API endpoints at `/test-api`
4. Verify environment variables are loaded

## üéØ Next Steps

The video calling system is now fully functional! You can:

1. **Test the functionality** with multiple users
2. **Customize the UI** to match your design
3. **Add more features** like:
   - Call history
   - Screen sharing
   - Group video calls
   - Call recording
   - Push notifications

## üìû How to Use

1. **Start a call**: Click the video camera icon next to any user
2. **Accept a call**: Click "Accept" when you receive a call notification
3. **During the call**: Use the control buttons to mute/unmute or end the call
4. **End a call**: Click the red phone button or close the modal

The system now properly connects remote users through Twilio Video SDK with real-time notifications and a complete user interface!
